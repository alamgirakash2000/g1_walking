# G1 Humanoid Robot - Rough Terrain Walking Guide ✅ WORKING

This IsaacLab project has been **DRAMATICALLY SIMPLIFIED** to focus exclusively on G1 humanoid robot rough terrain locomotion training and simulation.

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands (VERIFIED WORKING ✅)

### Training G1 Robot
```bash
./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/rsl_rl/train.py --task=Isaac-Velocity-Rough-G1-v0 --headless
```

### Testing/Playing G1 Robot
```bash
./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/rsl_rl/play.py --task=Isaac-Velocity-Rough-G1-v0
```

**✅ Both commands tested and confirmed working with simplified structure!**

## 🎯 MAJOR SIMPLIFICATION COMPLETED

### ⭐ BEFORE vs AFTER:
| **BEFORE** | **AFTER** |
|------------|-----------|
| 20+ config files across complex directories | **1 single file** (500 lines) |
| Multiple scattered configurations | **All-in-one consolidated task** |
| Hard to understand structure | **Self-contained & well-documented** |
| Complex import chains | **Direct, simple imports** |

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### **Basic Training**
```bash
# Train for 1000 iterations
./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/rsl_rl/train.py --task=Isaac-Velocity-Rough-G1-v0 --headless --max_iterations=1000

```

### **Testing Trained Models**
```bash
# Test with latest trained model
./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/rsl_rl/play.py --task=Isaac-Velocity-Rough-G1-v0

# Test specific model checkpoint
./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/rsl_rl/play.py --task=Isaac-Velocity-Rough-G1-v0 --load_run=2024-01-15_10-30-45
```

### **Customize Training (Edit the single file)**
```python
# Edit: source/isaaclab_tasks/isaaclab_tasks/g1_rough_terrain_task.py

# Example: Change training parameters
class G1RoughPPORunnerCfg(RslRlOnPolicyRunnerCfg):
    max_iterations = 5000              # Longer training
    num_steps_per_env = 32            # More steps per environment
    
# Example: Modify rewards
class G1RewardsCfg:
    track_lin_vel_xy_exp = RewTerm(func=mdp.track_lin_vel_xy_yaw_frame_exp, weight=2.0)  # Higher weight
```

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Import Errors:** Ensure you're using `./isaaclab.sh` launcher, not direct python
2. **CUDA Errors:** Check GPU memory with `nvidia-smi`
3. **Task Not Found:** Ensure `g1_rough_terrain_task.py` is in the correct location

### **Environment Setup**
```bash
# Ensure you're in the isaac_env conda environment
conda activate isaac_env

# Launch from project root directory
cd /path/to/your/Isaacproject
./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/reinforcement_learning/rsl_rl/train.py --task=Isaac-Velocity-Rough-G1-v0 --headless
```
